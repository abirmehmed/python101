Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) is fascinating. Here’s how it generally works, step by step:

1. Choose an Elliptic Curve
An elliptic curve is defined by an equation like 
y
2
=
x
3
+
a
x
+
b
 over a finite field.

Select constants 
a
 and 
b
 to define the curve. The field could be a prime field or a binary field.

2. Key Generation
Private Key: Choose a random integer 
d
 from the interval 
[
1
,
n
−
1
]
, where 
n
 is the order of the base point 
G
.

Public Key: Compute 
Q
=
d
G
, where 
Q
 is the public key, 
d
 is the private key, and 
G
 is a predefined point on the curve.

. Encryption (using the Elliptic Curve ElGamal Algorithm as an example)
Sender's Public Key: The sender will use the recipient’s public key 
Q
.

Random Integer: Choose a random integer 
k
.

Compute Points: Compute two points:

C
1
=
k
G

C
2
=
P
+
k
Q
, where 
P
 is the plaintext point on the curve.

Ciphertext: The ciphertext is the pair 
(
C
1
,
C
2
)
.

4. Decryption
